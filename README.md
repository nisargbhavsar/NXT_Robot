# NXT_Robot
Design Project

This design project was intended to solve the problem of loneliness in an ever more connected society.
It utilized a Lego NXT brain, Tetrix servo motors and various Lego and Tetrix pieces to play the board game, Connect 4.
While the project worked as designed, the main intent was to explore the design process with respect to the mechanical processes
of the robot (dropping a piece into the board in a controlled and repeatable fashion, moving along the game board with accuracy, 
detecting player pieces, and providing user feedback during the game), and the algorithmns (strategy for winning move, preventing user
from winning and checking if a win condition has been satisfied).
